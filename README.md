# GPB.tmbundle

This Textmate 2 bundle adds syntax highlighting and a few useful commands/snippets/cheat sheets for the [Google Protocol Buffers (proto3)](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3) description language. This was based on the original [protobuf-tmbundle](https://github.com/michaeledgar/protobuf-tmbundle) by Michael Edgar.


## Install

Go into any directory and execute:

    git clone https://github.com/tjackiw/GPB.tmbundle.git && open GPB.tmbundle

You'll be asked if you want to install the "Google Protocol Buffer" bundle, click "Install". 

From then on all of your `.proto` files will be picked up by the bundle.
